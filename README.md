## Introduction
This test is make from Daniel Fernandes

### Database Choise
I chose to use SQLite as a SQL Database, as it is simpler to create and perform queries. 

### Architecture choice
Due to the low complexity of the project and the database used, I chose not to use layer modeling such as Raw, Trusted and gold.
